## What is KMS?
 
KMS is a technology that allows you to activate Microsoft products with a local or online server. It is designed for organizations that have a large number of computers that need to be activated. KMS activation is valid for 180 days, and it can be renewed automatically or manually. KMS activation does not require a product key, but it requires a KMS client key that is pre-installed on the products.
