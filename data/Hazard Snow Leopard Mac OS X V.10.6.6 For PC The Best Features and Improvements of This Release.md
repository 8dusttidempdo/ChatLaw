- If you get a kernel panic or a black screen, try booting with different flags such as -x (safe mode), -f (ignore caches), -s (single user mode), etc.
- If you get a still waiting for root device error, try changing the SATA mode in your BIOS settings to AHCI or IDE.
- If you get a boot0 error, try using a different boot loader such as Chameleon or Clover.
- If you get a no sound or no network error, try installing different kexts (drivers) for your audio or ethernet devices using Kext Utility or Multibeast.
- If you want to update your system to a newer version of Mac OS X, make sure to backup your kexts and patches before applying the update, and reinstall them afterwards if necessary.
