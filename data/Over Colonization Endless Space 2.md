Endless Space 2 is a turn-based strategy game where you explore and colonize a vast galaxy. However, colonizing too many systems can have negative consequences for your empire's approval rating, which affects your productivity, influence, and political stability. In this article, we will explain what over colonization is, how it affects your gameplay, and how you can avoid or mitigate it.
 
## What is Over Colonization?
 
Over colonization occurs when you have more colonized systems than your empire's colonization limit. The colonization limit is determined by your empire's size and some technologies and traits. You can see your current colonization limit and over colonization penalty on the top right corner of the screen.

Each colony over the colonization limit adds -10 approval in each system. This is the penalty for going "wide" and expanding your territory[^4^]. Low approval can lead to rebellions, anarchy, and loss of control over your systems. It can also reduce your influence generation and make it harder to pass laws or form alliances.
 
## How to Avoid Over Colonization?
 
There are several ways to avoid or reduce over colonization in Endless Space 2. Here are some of them:
 
- **Be selective about where you colonize.** Not every system is worth colonizing. You should scout the galaxy with probes and look for systems that have strategic resources, luxury resources, anomalies, or high fertility. These systems will provide more benefits for your empire and justify the over colonization penalty.
- **Research technologies that increase your colonization limit.** There are some technologies in the Economy and Trade quadrant that can increase your colonization limit by a certain amount or percentage. For example, the Autonomous Administration technology increases your colonization limit by 1 per system level[^2^]. You should prioritize these technologies if you plan to expand your empire.
- **Use laws that boost your approval.** There are some laws that can increase your approval rating or reduce the over colonization penalty. For example, the Religious law called The Pilgrimage gives you +50% approval on all systems[^3^]. You should use these laws if you have enough influence and political support.
- **Build improvements that boost your approval.** There are some improvements that can increase your approval rating or reduce the over colonization penalty. For example, the Administrative AI system development gives you +1 colonization limit per system level[^1^]. You should build these improvements on your systems if you have enough production and dust.
- **Use heroes that boost your approval.** There are some heroes that have skills or traits that can increase your approval rating or reduce the over colonization penalty. For example, the Craver hero called Kreyang has a skill called The Greater Good that gives you +5% approval per depleted planet on system. You should assign these heroes to your systems or fleets if you have enough hero slots.

## Conclusion
 
Over colonization is a mechanic that balances the expansion of your empire in Endless Space 2. It can have negative effects on your approval rating, which can affect various aspects of your gameplay. However, you can avoid or mitigate over colonization by being selective about where you colonize, researching technologies that increase your colonization limit, using laws that boost your approval, building improvements that boost your approval, and using heroes that boost your approval. By doing so, you can enjoy the benefits of having a large empire without suffering too much from the drawbacks.
